## 🚩 The Problem: The "Friction Tax" on African Trade

Despite the promise of the **African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA)**, moving value across African borders remains a complex and expensive ordeal. Intra-African trade is currently throttled by three core **frictions**:

---

### 1. The Regulatory "Black Box"

Sub-Saharan Africa remains the most expensive region globally for cross-border payments, with average costs exceeding **8%** (vs. the G20 target of <3%). This is largely due to fragmented legal frameworks:

- **Manual Compliance:** Businesses must navigate a maze of disparate AML/KYC rules and capital controls (e.g., **CEMAC, ECOWAS, EAC**) that differ by jurisdiction.  
- **Burdensome Reporting:** According to the **FSB 2025 report**, the lack of automated, harmonized data exchange leads to "intended frictions" that result in settlement delays of **3–7 days**.

### 2. The Paperwork Bottleneck

Trade documentation—port clearances, bills of lading, and local invoices—is still heavily analog and non-standardized.

- **Information Asymmetry:** Finance teams spend days manually reconciling physical documents with bank records.  
- **Documentation Gaps:** SMEs are often locked out of formal trade corridors because they cannot meet the rigorous, manual reporting standards required by traditional correspondent banks.

### 3. High Currency Volatility & Hidden Fees

Traditional correspondent banking relies on a "chain" of intermediaries. Each link adds:

- **Hidden FX Spreads:** Merchants lose significant value to unfavorable exchange rates before the money even arrives.  
- **Liquidity Traps:** Small businesses often have to hold large reserves of USD cash just to hedge against local currency devaluation, draining their working capital.

## 📉 The Result

For a small merchant in **Douala** paying a supplier in **Nairobi**, the "cost of doing business" isn't just the price of goods—it's the **week-long wait** and the **10% lost to the system**.
